    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>Front-end developer from Cape Town, South Africa</h3>
    <pre class="about-me">
        I am a 24 years old, 
        Front-end developer 
        from Cape Town South, Africa.
        The SheCodes foundation program 
        helped me realize my dream 
        of being a developer.

        Wanna know more about the program?
        Click on <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/" target="_blank">this link</a>
        for more info.

        I have also done Java and C as
        modules at university, 
        since my qualification 
        is Computer Engineering, 
        programing or 
        coding isnt really that 
        much, so I had to learn
        a lot of things by myself using 
        online resources 
        such as SheCodes 
        and Freecodecamp. 

        I am so excited for 
        next year 
        because I will be 
        a university graduate
        with my SheCodes certifications
        that I plan on finishing 
        during the festive season.
        I will also be doing 
        a lot of projects 
        and pushing them 
        to github, 
        I have so many ideas
        of projects I want to do 
        and I can't to start.
